# DIAexchange

This repo controls issues/discussions and guidelines about DIAexchange project. The DIAexchange project is a collaboration between [PeptideAtlas](https://peptideatlas.org/), [PRIDE database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/) and [Andy Jones's Group](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computational-biology-facility/).  

Here we list the ongoing projects of the Grant and the software developed within the Grant.

## Standarization of DIA data

Withing this project we aim to standarize the way DIA data is disaminated in the public domain including the deposition to ProteomeXchange repositories. 

### DIA experiments in SDRF-proteomics

[SDRF-proteomics](https://github.com/bigbio/proteomics-sample-metadata) is an standard format for sample metadata annotation of proteomics experiments and also represent the experimental design of proteomics experiments. In the first release of the [format](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26111-3) we included multiple examples of LFQ and TMT experiments. In this grant we aim the following: 

- Include multiple datasets examples about How to annotate properly DIA datasets in SDRF-proteomics.
- Provide a list of well-annotated experiments in SDRF-proteomics for reanalysis by the community.
